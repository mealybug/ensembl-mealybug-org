<!-- {about} -->
  <p>The longtailed mealybug, <i>Pseudococcus longispinus</i> (Targioni Tozzetti), is a widely-distributed pest that feeds on many economically important hosts, particularly tropical fruits and ornamentals. Assembly and annotation was performed by Dominik R. Laetsch (Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh, UK). Data was generated by John McCutcheon (Division of Biological Sciences, University of Montana, USA) and Laura Ross (Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh, UK).</p>

<!-- {about} -->
<!-- {assembly} -->
  <p>The genome was assembled from PacBio RSII reads (>200X), followed by long-read and short-read polishing using <a href="https://github.com/ruanjue/wtdbg2"><TT>wtdbg2 v2.4</TT></a></p>
  <p>Symbionts and contaminants were filtered using <a href="https://github.com/DRL/blobtools"><TT>BlobTools v1.1.1</TT></a></p>
<!-- {assembly} -->
<!-- {annotation} -->
  <p>The assembly was annotated using <TT>BRAKER v2</TT> and masked using <TT>RepeatMasker v4.0.7</TT> (Tarailo&dash;Graovac &amp; Chen, 2009)</p>
